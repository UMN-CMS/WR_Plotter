## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
This repository is structured to separate executable scripts, core analysis logic, and documentation.

```
bin/        # user-facing CLI entrypoints (tiny wrappers).
data/       # configs & static metadata (tracked, human-editable)
docs/       # Contains documentation markdown.
python/     # the importable library (public API)
scripts/    # developer & maintenance utilities
rootfiles/  # input ROOT/hist files 
test/       # Holds test and development scripts.
```

---

## Getting Started
Begin by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:UMN-CMS/WrCoffea.git
cd WrCoffea
```
Create and source a virtual Python environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv wr-env
source wr-env/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Grid UI
To authenticate for accessing grid resources, use:
```bash
voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms -valid 192:00
```

### ROOT
To enable ROOT functionality, source the appropriate LCG release:
```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_106/x86_64-el9-gcc13-opt/setup.sh
```
If using UMNâ€™s setup, use:
```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_104/x86_64-centos8-gcc11-opt/setup.sh
```

## Examples

### Making control region plots
To make control region plots 
```
python3 bin/plot_control_regions.py --era 2022 --dir dy_ht
```
One can also specify `--era Run3Summer22` or `--era Run3Summer22EE`.

The `--dir` argument will look for ROOT files saved in that directory, so `--dir` must match whatever was used with `bin/run_analysis.py`.

Note that in order for this to run, ROOT files must exist for the following samples:
```
Run3Summer22/WR_Analyzer/DYJets.root
Run3Summer22/WR_Analyzer/TTbar.root
```
